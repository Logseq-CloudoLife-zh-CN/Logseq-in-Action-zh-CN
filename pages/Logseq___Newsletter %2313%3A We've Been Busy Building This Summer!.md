- # Newsletter \#13: We've Been Busy Building This Summer!
	- ![Newsletter #13: We've Been Busy Building This Summer!](https://blog.logseq.com/content/images/size/w960/2022/09/building-featured.png)
	- Dear Logseqers,
	- We're back from our newsletter break! As the community was enjoying the summer and not sharing as many resources, we used the time to keep building. In this newsletter, we'll share some of the things we've been working on and what you can expect next from us.
		- [[community]]
	- This summer, we also ran two learning sprints to help you master Logseq queries.Â [Go to the queries forum](https://discuss.logseq.com/tags/c/learning-sprints/queries/20/lesson)Â or scroll down towards the end of this newsletter to catch up with the curriculum.
		- [[catch up with sth.]]
		- [[curriculum]]
	- Last but not least, we finish the newsletter with a roundup of new community plugins.
		- [[Last but not least]]
		- [[roundup]]
	- What workflows will you create with these new building blocks?
	- ## Get early access to Logseq Sync
		- Probably the most frustrating part of Logseq is syncing between different devices.
			- [[frustrating]]
				- [[frustrate]]
		- As avid mobile users ourselves, we often ran into sync conflicts when using services like iCloud and Dropbox. We heard the same from you, not to mention the privacy concerns of using such services. That's why we've been working on our own sync service, offering end to end encryption so don't have to trustÂ _anyone_Â with the keys to your data (including us).

		- We've been testing Logseq Sync with a small group of testers and our Sponsors (those whoÂ [donate more than $15 per month](https://opencollective.com/logseq/contribute/sponsors-21163)). Now that we've solved some important challenges, we're almost ready to make Sync available to our Backers as well (those whoÂ [donate $5 per month](https://opencollective.com/logseq/contribute/backers-21161)). If you're a Backer (or become one now), expect an email with more information later this week.

		- We don't know yet when Sync will be generally available. But if you want to get early access and provide us with your invaluable feedback, pleaseÂ [become a Backer](https://opencollective.com/logseq/contribute/backers-21161)Â or aÂ [Sponsor](https://opencollective.com/logseq/contribute/sponsors-21163).

	- ## What has changed since 0.7.9.
		- When we sent the last newsletter, we were on version 0.7.9. of Logseq Beta. Over the past weeks, we've iterated quickly and are now up toÂ [0.8.7.](https://github.com/logseq/logseq/releases/tag/0.8.7)Â These are the most important changes in the past weeks:
			- Massive performance improvements for large graphs.
				- [[massive]]
				- [[improvement]]
			- Improved linked references, including a search field for values.
			- [(Page) properties](https://docs.logseq.com/#/page/term%2Fproperties)Â are now clickable and create pages (thus offering more ways to search).
			- Added support for aÂ [global config file](https://docs.logseq.com/#/page/Global%20configuration), which applies your configuration to all of your graphs.
			- Added support forÂ `Ctrl-f`Â (`Cmd-f`Â on macOS) toÂ [find in a page](https://docs.logseq.com/#/page/Find%20in%20page). This feature works on every page in Logseq, including built-in keyboard shortcuts page.
			- Thanks to the community, Logseq is now available in the following languages: English, French, German, Dutch, Afrikaans, Norwegian, Polish, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese (Brazilian and European), Turkish, Russian, Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), Japanese, and Korean.
	- ## Take a deep dive into Logseq queries
		- The summer query sprints are a wrap! In July and August, over 250 of you decided to take the time and energy to better grok Logseq.
